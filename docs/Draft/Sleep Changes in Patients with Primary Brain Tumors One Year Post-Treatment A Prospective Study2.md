# Sleep Changes in Patients with Primary Brain Tumors One Year Post-Treatment A Prospective Study

## Background

### Association Between Brain Tumors and Sleep Disorders

Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent and heterogeneous among patients with brain tumors, with a significantly higher prevalence compared to the general population. Approximately 61.5% of patients with primary brain tumors experience sleep disorders, including insomnia, sleep apnea, and hypersomnia ([[allgood2023CorrelationSleepDisturbance|(Allgood et al., 2023)]]). Gliomas, in particular, are associated with specific types of sleep disturbances, which may be related to tumor location affecting brain regions responsible for sleep-wake regulation ([[allgood2023CorrelationSleepDisturbance|(Allgood et al., 2023)]]; [[ortega-leonard2022SleepArchitecturePatients|(Ortega-Leonard et al., 2022)]]). For instance, patients with frontal lobe tumors exhibit significant alterations in sleep architecture, such as reduced total sleep time, increased wake after sleep onset, and decreased REM sleep ([[ortega-leonard2022SleepArchitecturePatients|(Ortega-Leonard et al., 2022)]]).

Sleep disorders are also highly prevalent among pediatric and adolescent patients with brain tumors. Sleep-related breathing disorders—such as obstructive and central sleep apnea—as well as hypersomnia are among the most common, affecting up to 64% of this population ([[helligsoe2022SystematicReviewSleep|(Helligsoe et al., 2022)]]; [[pickering2021BrainTumoursResult|(Pickering et al., 2021)]]). These issues significantly impact the quality of life and neuropsychological functioning in pediatric patients ([[chiang2022EffectsSleepDisturbance|(Chiang et al., 2022)]]; [[vankooten2019HighOccurrenceSleep|(van Kooten et al., 2019)]]).

Studies have also indicated that sleep disturbances in brain tumor patients are closely associated with treatment modalities. Up to 90% of patients experience somnolence syndrome following radiotherapy ([[powell2011SomnolenceSyndromePatients|(Powell et al., 2011)]]), and those receiving corticosteroids are nearly six times more likely to develop sleep disorders ([[willis2022SleepDisturbancePrimary|(Willis et al., 2022)]]). Thus, sleep problems are not only related to the tumor itself but also to the treatment and its side effects.

Moreover, sleep disturbances may serve as early indicators of tumor progression or recurrence and could be utilized as potential clinical diagnostic and monitoring tools ([[allgood2023CorrelationSleepDisturbance|(Allgood et al., 2023)]]; [[king2022ExploringPrevalenceBurden|(King et al., 2022)]]). Routine sleep screening is recommended for patients with brain tumors, along with appropriate interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) or exercise therapy to improve overall quality of life ([[edinger2021BehavioralPsychologicalTreatments|(Edinger et al., 2021)]]; [[sandler2021PhysicalActivityExercise|(Sandler et al., 2021)]]).

### Changes in Sleep Problems Before and After Brain Tumor Treatment

Previous studies have reported a high prevalence of sleep disturbances even before treatment initiation in patients with brain tumors. For instance, approximately 67% of glioma patients exhibit sleep problems prior to treatment ([[kopelke2022RiskFactorsSleep|(Kopelke et al., 2022)]]), and nearly 60% of untreated primary brain tumor patients report insomnia, with about 80% experiencing poor sleep quality ([[lin2023SleepDisturbanceAdults|(Lin et al., 2023)]]). Treatment itself—such as cranial radiotherapy—can exacerbate sleep problems, with over 90% of patients developing pronounced somnolence symptoms ([[powell2011SomnolenceSyndromePatients|(Powell et al., 2011)]]). Additionally, patients undergoing surgical intervention also experience greater fatigue and sleep disturbances compared to healthy individuals ([[kitselaar2022FatigueNeurosurgeryPatients|(Kitselaar et al., 2022)]]).

However, longitudinal and dynamic studies on changes in sleep problems before and after treatment remain limited. Most existing studies have only conducted cross-sectional analyses at specific treatment stages, failing to capture the trajectory of sleep disturbances throughout the entire course of tumor treatment ([[martin2023PrevalenceManagementSleep|(Martin et al., 2023)]]; [[willis2022SleepDisturbancePrimary|(Willis et al., 2022)]]). The progression and contributing factors of sleep disturbances in relation to treatment remain underexplored.

Our study aims to systematically investigate changes in sleep disturbances before and after treatment in patients with brain tumors, and further analyze potential influencing factors such as tumor location, treatment modality, and medication use. This study seeks to fill the research gap and provide comprehensive evidence for future clinical treatment and sleep management strategies.

## Methods  
This study employed a prospective cohort design, modeled on our prior research framework. A total of 72 patients diagnosed with primary brain tumors were enrolled. Inclusion criteria included adult patients (aged 18 years or older) with a confirmed PBT diagnosis, scheduled for standard treatment (e.g., surgery, radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy), and able to participate in a one-year follow-up. Exclusion criteria encompassed pre-existing sleep disorders unrelated to the tumor, severe psychiatric conditions, or inability to adhere to study protocols.  

Sleep changes were evaluated using both subjective and objective measures. Subjective data were gathered through validated questionnaires, specifically the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), administered at baseline (pre-treatment), 6 months, and 12 months post-treatment. Objective data were collected using wearable devices (e.g., actigraphy watches) worn by participants for seven consecutive days at each time point. These devices measured parameters such as total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and awakenings. Data analysis methods and ethical approval details are not specified here due to lack of additional information, but all participants provided informed consent.

## Results

### Patient Composition Analysis

As shown in Table 1, the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients before brain tumor treatment revealed significant differences between those with benign and malignant tumors. Specifically, patients with malignant tumors were more likely to use steroids (5.41% vs. 27.27%, p = 0.012) and anti-epileptic drugs (10.81% vs. 33.33%, p = 0.022), and had significantly lower Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) scores (88.11 ± 5.18 vs. 85.45 ± 6.17, p = 0.008). Female patients were more prevalent in the benign tumor group (64.86% vs. 39.39%, p = 0.03). No significant differences were observed in age, BMI, education level, marital status, or employment status. These findings indicate that there are notable clinical differences between benign and malignant brain tumor patients prior to treatment, especially in medication use and functional performance.

### Completion Rate Analysis

The overall completion rates of the sleep questionnaires at 6 months (2nd follow-up) and 12 months (3rd follow-up) were 71% and 64%, respectively. Notably, the malignant tumor group demonstrated a higher questionnaire completion rate at 12 months compared to the benign group (76% vs. 54%). In terms of actigraphy (watch-type device) adherence, overall completion rates were slightly higher, at 77% and 67% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Similarly, the malignant tumor group had a higher device adherence rate than the benign group at 12 months (79% vs. 57%). Overall, adherence to actigraphy was better than that of subjective questionnaires.

### Changes in Subjective Sleep Assessments Before and After Treatment

As shown in Table 3, subjective sleep assessments were conducted at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months post-treatment using CPSQI, CAIS, CESS, and TBFI. In general, there were no statistically significant improvements in most sleep indicators after treatment. However, fatigue levels (TBFI) significantly increased between 6 and 12 months (p = 0.02), particularly in the benign tumor group (p = 0.03). No significant differences were observed in other subjective sleep indicators across time points or between benign and malignant groups (all p > 0.05).

### Changes in Anxiety and Depression Before and After Treatment

As shown in Table 5, the changes in anxiety and depression among brain tumor patients before and after treatment revealed a significant decrease in anxiety scores (HADS-Anxiety) at 6 months post-treatment (p = 0.01), particularly among those with malignant tumors (p = 0.04). However, anxiety levels slightly increased at 12 months, though not reaching statistical significance. Depression scores (HADS-Depression) showed no significant changes across time points or between tumor types (all p > 0.05), indicating relatively stable depressive symptoms.

### Objective Sleep Changes Measured by Actigraphy Before and After Treatment

As presented in Table 7, objective sleep parameters measured via actigraphy showed minimal changes in total sleep time, sleep latency, and sleep efficiency across treatment time points, with no significant differences overall. However, the dichotomy index (I<O≤97.5), an indicator of circadian rhythm stability, showed significant differences between benign and malignant tumor patients at all time points: baseline (p = 0.005), 6 months (p = 0.017), and 12 months (p = 0.019), indicating greater circadian rhythm disruption in the malignant tumor group.

## Discussion

### 1. Sleep Disturbances Are Prevalent and Clinically Significant in Brain Tumor Patients

This study confirmed the high prevalence of sleep disturbances among brain tumor patients, as evidenced by both subjective questionnaire results and objective actigraphy measures. These findings are consistent with previous reports showing sleep disturbance prevalence ranging from 37% to 81.8% in this population ([[allgood2023CorrelationSleepDisturbance|(Allgood et al., 2023)]]; [[armstrong2016SleepwakeDisturbancePatients|(Armstrong et al., 2016)]]; [[martin2023PrevalenceManagementSleep|(Martin et al., 2023)]]). Armstrong et al. highlighted sleep disturbance as one of the most severe subjective symptoms in brain tumor patients, with higher prevalence than in general oncology populations ([[armstrong2016SleepwakeDisturbancePatients|(Armstrong et al., 2016)]]). Allgood et al. further identified correlations between specific sleep disorders and glioma tumor locations ([[allgood2023CorrelationSleepDisturbance|(Allgood et al., 2023)]]). Our findings reinforce the need for routine sleep monitoring and intervention in this patient population to improve quality of life.

### 2. Fatigue and Anxiety Changes—Literature Support and New Insights

Our study demonstrated a significant increase in fatigue symptoms at 12 months post-treatment, consistent with findings by Kitselaar et al., who emphasized fatigue as a critical symptom in brain tumor management ([[kitselaar2022FatigueNeurosurgeryPatients|(Kitselaar et al., 2022)]]). Additionally, we observed a novel reduction in anxiety scores at 6 months post-treatment, particularly among malignant tumor patients. Figuration et al. reported that up to 48% of adult brain tumor patients exhibit clinically significant anxiety post-treatment ([[figuracion2022SurveillanceLongtermComplications|(Figuracion et al., 2022)]]), yet few studies have documented improvements in anxiety levels. Potential explanations include increased sense of control or reduced uncertainty after treatment, warranting further investigation.

### 3. Lack of Improvement in Subjective Sleep Metrics and Role of Tumor Location

In this study, subjective sleep metrics (e.g., insomnia, hypersomnia) did not show significant improvement post-treatment, differing from Powell et al.'s findings where over 90% of patients reported increased somnolence after radiotherapy ([[powell2011SomnolenceSyndromePatients|(Powell et al., 2011)]]). Although fatigue worsened, other sleep measures remained stable. While literature strongly supports associations between tumor location and sleep disturbances ([[allgood2023CorrelationSleepDisturbance|(Allgood et al., 2023)]]; [[mitterling2025SleepDisturbanceStructured|(Mitterling et al., 2025)]]), we did not observe clear differences in subjective sleep between benign and malignant tumor types, possibly due to unmeasured confounders or limited sensitivity of self-report tools.

### 4. Impact of Brain Tumors on Circadian Rhythm Stability—Greater Disruption in Malignancies

Our results showed that malignant brain tumor patients exhibited significantly poorer circadian rhythm stability compared to benign tumor patients, consistent with prior studies. Pickering et al. noted disrupted circadian rhythms in pediatric brain tumor patients due to tumor involvement in rhythm-regulating regions ([[pickering2021BrainTumoursChildren|(Pickering et al., 2021)]]). Mitterling et al. also reported widespread rhythm disturbances among glioma patients ([[mitterling2025SleepDisturbanceStructured|(Mitterling et al., 2025)]]). Our study adds that benign tumor patients retain better circadian stability, an aspect underexplored in prior literature. This may relate to more aggressive disease and intensive interventions in malignant cases, which could disrupt intrinsic physiological rhythms.

### 5. Higher Acceptability of Actigraphy Over Subjective Questionnaires—A Methodological Insight

Our findings showed a consistently higher adherence rate to actigraphy compared to subjective questionnaires, an observation rarely discussed in existing literature. While objective sleep tools such as actigraphy and polysomnography offer more accurate assessments ([[buttner-teleaga2021SleepDisordersCancer|(Buttner-Teleaga et al., 2021)]]; [[lin2023SleepDisturbanceAdults|(Lin et al., 2023)]]), few studies have addressed patient acceptability. The higher usage rate of actigraphy in our study may be attributed to its convenience and low interference, making it more compatible with patients’ daily routines. Patients may also avoid the cognitive or psychological burden of completing subjective questionnaires, especially during emotionally challenging treatment phases. Future research should focus on integrating patient-centered, practical tools to enhance compliance and data quality in sleep health assessments.

## Conclusion

This study confirmed the widespread and complex nature of sleep disturbances among brain tumor patients and identified significant changes in fatigue and anxiety levels following treatment, particularly the lesser-known improvement in anxiety symptoms. No significant changes were observed in subjective metrics of insomnia or hypersomnia, nor were there clear differences in sleep perception between benign and malignant tumors. However, objective measures revealed poorer circadian rhythm stability in patients with malignant tumors, highlighting circadian regulation as a potential focus for future research. Finally, we found that actigraphy had better patient acceptability than subjective questionnaires, providing methodological insights for future studies. Overall, our findings emphasize the need to integrate sleep, fatigue, anxiety, and circadian rhythm assessments into the holistic care of brain tumor patients to improve quality of life and treatment outcomes.
