## Background

### Association Between Brain Tumors and Sleep Disorders

Sleep disorders are highly prevalent and diverse among brain tumor patients, with an occurrence significantly higher than the general population. Approximately 61.5% of primary brain tumor patients experience sleep disturbances, including insomnia, sleep apnea, and hypersomnia ([[allgood2023CorrelationSleepDisturbance|(Allgood et al., 2023)]]). Gliomas are particularly associated with specific sleep disorders, possibly due to tumor locations impacting brain regions responsible for regulating sleep-wake cycles ([[allgood2023CorrelationSleepDisturbance|(Allgood et al., 2023)]]; [[ortega-leonard2022SleepArchitecturePatients|(Ortega-Leonard et al., 2022)]]). For instance, frontal lobe tumors significantly alter sleep architecture, characterized by decreased total sleep duration, increased awakenings, and reduced REM sleep ([[ortega-leonard2022SleepArchitecturePatients|(Ortega-Leonard et al., 2022)]]).

Sleep disturbances are also severe among pediatric and adolescent brain tumor patients, particularly obstructive and central sleep apnea, and hypersomnia, with prevalence rates up to 64% ([[helligsoe2022SystematicReviewSleep|(Helligsoe et al., 2022)]]; [[pickering2021BrainTumoursResult|(Pickering et al., 2021)]]). These disturbances significantly impair quality of life and neuropsychological functioning in pediatric patients ([[chiang2022EffectsSleepDisturbance|(Chiang et al., 2022)]]; [[vankooten2019HighOccurrenceSleep|(van Kooten et al., 2019)]]).

Research indicates a close relationship between sleep disorders in brain tumor patients and treatment methods. For example, post-radiotherapy hypersomnolence syndrome affects up to 90% of patients ([[powell2011SomnolenceSyndromePatients|(Powell et al., 2011)]]), while steroid treatment increases the risk of sleep disorders nearly sixfold ([[willis2022SleepDisturbancePrimary|(Willis et al., 2022)]]). Thus, sleep issues are not only related to tumors themselves but also closely linked to treatment and its side effects.

Additionally, sleep disorders may serve as early indicators of tumor progression or recurrence, potentially useful for clinical diagnosis and monitoring ([[allgood2023CorrelationSleepDisturbance|(Allgood et al., 2023)]]; [[king2022ExploringPrevalenceBurden|(King et al., 2022)]]). Routine sleep screening and appropriate interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT-I) or exercise therapy are recommended to enhance overall patient quality of life ([[edinger2021BehavioralPsychologicalTreatments|(Edinger et al., 2021)]]; [[sandler2021PhysicalActivityExercise|(Sandler et al., 2021)]]).

### Sleep Disorders Before and After Brain Tumor Treatment

Previous studies indicate a high prevalence of sleep disturbances among brain tumor patients even before treatment, with approximately 67% of glioma patients reporting sleep problems ([[kopelke2022RiskFactorsSleep|(Kopelke et al., 2022)]]). Similarly, nearly 60% of untreated primary brain tumor patients report insomnia, and around 80% report poor sleep quality ([[lin2023SleepDisturbanceAdults|(Lin et al., 2023)]]). Treatments such as cranial radiotherapy often exacerbate sleep issues, with more than 90% experiencing significant hypersomnolence ([[powell2011SomnolenceSyndromePatients|(Powell et al., 2011)]]). Furthermore, patients undergoing surgery report significantly greater fatigue and sleep disturbances compared to healthy populations ([[kitselaar2022FatigueNeurosurgeryPatients|(Kitselaar et al., 2022)]]).

However, longitudinal and dynamic evaluations of sleep issues across treatment stages remain insufficient, with most studies adopting cross-sectional approaches, failing to capture the dynamic progression of sleep disorders throughout the treatment course ([[martin2023PrevalenceManagementSleep|(Martin et al., 2023)]]; [[willis2022SleepDisturbancePrimary|(Willis et al., 2022)]]). Comprehensive analyses of sleep disorders over the full treatment period and their influencing factors are urgently needed.

Our study systematically investigates changes in sleep disorders before and after treatment in brain tumor patients, exploring factors such as tumor location, treatment type, and medication use, to fill this research gap and provide a comprehensive reference for clinical treatment and sleep management strategies.

## Methods  
This study employed a prospective cohort design, modeled on our prior research framework. A total of 72 patients diagnosed with primary brain tumors were enrolled. Inclusion criteria included adult patients (aged 18 years or older) with a confirmed PBT diagnosis, scheduled for standard treatment (e.g., surgery, radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy), and able to participate in a one-year follow-up. Exclusion criteria encompassed pre-existing sleep disorders unrelated to the tumor, severe psychiatric conditions, or inability to adhere to study protocols.  

Sleep changes were evaluated using both subjective and objective measures. Subjective data were gathered through validated questionnaires, specifically the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), administered at baseline (pre-treatment), 6 months, and 12 months post-treatment. Objective data were collected using wearable devices (e.g., actigraphy watches) worn by participants for seven consecutive days at each time point. These devices measured parameters such as total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and awakenings. Data analysis methods and ethical approval details are not specified here due to lack of additional information, but all participants provided informed consent.

## Discussion  
The link between primary brain tumors and sleep disturbances is well-documented in existing literature, though longitudinal studies tracking sleep over extended periods remain limited. This study addresses that gap by examining sleep changes in PBT patients across a one-year post-treatment period, building on our team’s earlier findings. The use of both subjective questionnaires (PSQI and ISI) and objective wearable devices distinguishes our approach, providing a comprehensive view of sleep quality and patterns that single-method studies may overlook.  

Comparisons with other academic research are constrained here due to the absence of specific referenced studies. Generally, the literature suggests that sleep disturbances in PBT patients may persist due to factors such as tumor location, treatment side effects, or medication use, though exact mechanisms and timelines vary. Our prospective design enables an exploration of whether these disturbances resolve, worsen, or stabilize over time, though definitive conclusions await the results. The dual-method data collection enhances reliability, capturing both patient perceptions and quantifiable sleep metrics, which may reveal discrepancies or alignments not evident in prior work.  

Limitations of this study include the relatively small sample size (n=72) and potential variability in tumor characteristics or treatment regimens, which could affect generalizability. Without specific results, further interpretation or comparison with other studies is not possible at this stage. Future research could benefit from larger cohorts, subgroup analyses (e.g., by tumor type or treatment), and additional tools like neuroimaging to link brain changes to sleep outcomes. Clinically, understanding sleep trajectories in PBT patients could guide interventions to improve post-treatment recovery, though specific recommendations depend on forthcoming findings.
