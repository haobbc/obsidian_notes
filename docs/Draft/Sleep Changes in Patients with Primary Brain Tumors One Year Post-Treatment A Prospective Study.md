# Sleep Changes in Patients with Primary Brain Tumors One Year Post-Treatment: A Prospective Study

## Abstract  
(To be completed after the Results section is provided.)

## Background  
Primary brain tumors (PBTs) are associated with a range of neurological disruptions, including sleep-related disturbances such as insomnia and altered sleep patterns. These issues may stem from the tumor’s impact on brain function, psychological factors, or the effects of treatments such as surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. Our research team has previously identified preliminary evidence of sleep alterations in PBT patients, though detailed findings from that work are not specified here. This study extends those observations by investigating how sleep evolves in PBT patients over the year following treatment. The purpose is to explore the trajectory of sleep changes post-treatment, given the critical role of sleep in quality of life, cognitive function, and recovery for this population.

## Methods  
This study employed a prospective cohort design, modeled on our prior research framework. A total of 72 patients diagnosed with primary brain tumors were enrolled. Inclusion criteria included adult patients (aged 18 years or older) with a confirmed PBT diagnosis, scheduled for standard treatment (e.g., surgery, radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy), and able to participate in a one-year follow-up. Exclusion criteria encompassed pre-existing sleep disorders unrelated to the tumor, severe psychiatric conditions, or inability to adhere to study protocols.  

Sleep changes were evaluated using both subjective and objective measures. Subjective data were gathered through validated questionnaires, specifically the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), administered at baseline (pre-treatment), 6 months, and 12 months post-treatment. Objective data were collected using wearable devices (e.g., actigraphy watches) worn by participants for seven consecutive days at each time point. These devices measured parameters such as total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and awakenings. Data analysis methods and ethical approval details are not specified here due to lack of additional information, but all participants provided informed consent.

## Discussion  
The link between primary brain tumors and sleep disturbances is well-documented in existing literature, though longitudinal studies tracking sleep over extended periods remain limited. This study addresses that gap by examining sleep changes in PBT patients across a one-year post-treatment period, building on our team’s earlier findings. The use of both subjective questionnaires (PSQI and ISI) and objective wearable devices distinguishes our approach, providing a comprehensive view of sleep quality and patterns that single-method studies may overlook.  

Comparisons with other academic research are constrained here due to the absence of specific referenced studies. Generally, the literature suggests that sleep disturbances in PBT patients may persist due to factors such as tumor location, treatment side effects, or medication use, though exact mechanisms and timelines vary. Our prospective design enables an exploration of whether these disturbances resolve, worsen, or stabilize over time, though definitive conclusions await the results. The dual-method data collection enhances reliability, capturing both patient perceptions and quantifiable sleep metrics, which may reveal discrepancies or alignments not evident in prior work.  

Limitations of this study include the relatively small sample size (n=72) and potential variability in tumor characteristics or treatment regimens, which could affect generalizability. Without specific results, further interpretation or comparison with other studies is not possible at this stage. Future research could benefit from larger cohorts, subgroup analyses (e.g., by tumor type or treatment), and additional tools like neuroimaging to link brain changes to sleep outcomes. Clinically, understanding sleep trajectories in PBT patients could guide interventions to improve post-treatment recovery, though specific recommendations depend on forthcoming findings.
