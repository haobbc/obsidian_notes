# TL;DR (Summary)
- 97% of healthcare professionals (HCPs) expected some level of sleep disturbance in people with brain tumors (BT).
- Only 20% of HCPs reported routinely reviewing sleep-related symptoms during consultations.
- 92% of HCPs identified corticosteroids as the most relevant risk factor for sleep disturbance.
- Utilized the Capability Opportunity Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model to identify barriers and facilitators of sleep symptom care in neuro-oncology.
- Authors suggest that incorporating a screening tool for dexamethasone side effects, including sleep items, into routine care could be beneficial.
- They emphasize the need for tailored and evidence-based interventions to address sleep disturbance in people with malignant BT.
- HCPs perceived sleep disturbance as highly prevalent in neuro-oncology but identified several barriers to effective management.
