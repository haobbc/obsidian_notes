# TL;DR (Summary)
- Most adults with brain cancer were insufficiently active from diagnosis through to post-treatment.
- Higher levels of physical activity (PA) were associated with lower severity of brain cancer specific concerns and higher quality of life (QoL).
- Exercise interventions were found to be safe, feasible, and potentially beneficial for symptom severity, aerobic capacity, body composition, and PA levels.
- This systematic review is the first to comprehensively assess PA and exercise in adults with primary brain cancer, providing a foundation for future research.
- The review highlights the feasibility and potential benefits of exercise interventions specifically tailored for brain cancer patients.
- Authors suggest that it is likely appropriate to promote physical activity among those with brain cancer, despite the challenges they face.
- The need for higher quality, population-based, longitudinal studies to better understand PA patterns and the benefits of exercise is emphasized.
- Authors recommend a tailored, individualised approach to exercise prescription for brain cancer patients.
- The review found that the proportion of insufficiently active patients increases during treatment, similar to other cancer cohorts.
- The evidence supporting the benefits of PA and exercise in brain cancer patients is graded as weak, indicating a need for more robust studies.

# 中文摘要 (TL;DR)
- 大多數腦癌成年患者從診斷到治療後的體能活動不足。
- 較高的體能活動水平與腦癌特定問題的嚴重性較低及生活品質較高相關。
- 運動干預被發現對症狀嚴重性、需氧能力、體組成和體能活動水平是安全、可行的，並可能有益。
- 這項系統性回顧是首次全面評估原發性腦癌成年患者的體能活動和運動，為未來研究奠定了基礎。
- 該回顧強調了專為腦癌患者量身定制的運動干預的可行性和潛在益處。
- 作者建議儘管腦癌患者面臨挑戰，促進他們進行體能活動可能是適當的。
- 強調需要更高質量、基於人群的縱向研究，以更好地理解體能活動模式和運動的好處。
- 作者建議對腦癌患者採用量身定制的運動處方方法。
- 回顧發現，與其他癌症群體相似，治療期間體能活動不足的患者比例增加。
- 支持腦癌患者體能活動和運動益處的證據被評為弱，表明需要更強有力的研究。
