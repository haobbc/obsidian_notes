# TL;DR (Summary)
- Acute total sleep deprivation significantly increased cortisol levels (p<0.0001), with cortisol levels higher during the first half of the night and in the morning hours.
- Chronic circadian misalignment significantly reduced cortisol levels (p<0.05), with a significant reduction in 24-hour cortisol area under the curve (AUC) levels observed after weeks of misalignment.
- Circadian misalignment significantly increased plasma levels of TNF-α, IL-10, and CRP (p<0.05), with TNF-α levels higher during scheduled wakefulness.
- Utilized a 25-day laboratory entrainment protocol to induce chronic circadian misalignment, allowing for detailed assessment of cortisol and inflammatory markers over time.
- Employed frequent blood sampling and constant routine protocols to accurately measure circadian rhythms and inflammatory responses, overcoming limitations of previous studies with less frequent sampling.
- Authors suggest that acute sleep deprivation and chronic circadian misalignment represent different physiological challenges, with the former increasing cortisol and the latter reducing it.
- Authors emphasize the need for future studies to assess the impact of circadian misalignment on a broader range of inflammatory markers and in different populations, including those with pre-existing diseases.
- The study highlights the importance of considering both pro- and anti-inflammatory proteins to accurately interpret the inflammatory state during sleep and circadian disruption.
- Findings indicate that chronic circadian misalignment may not lead to a prevailing pro-inflammatory state in healthy individuals, as both pro- and anti-inflammatory proteins increased.

# 中文摘要 (TL;DR)
- 急性全夜睡眠剝奪顯著增加了皮質醇水平（p<0.0001），在夜間的前半段和早晨時段皮質醇水平較高。
- 慢性晝夜節律錯位顯著降低了皮質醇水平（p<0.05），在錯位數週後觀察到24小時皮質醇面積下的曲線（AUC）水平顯著降低。
- 晝夜節律錯位顯著增加了血漿中的TNF-α、IL-10和CRP水平（p<0.05），TNF-α水平在預定的清醒時間段較高。
- 使用25天的實驗室同步協議來誘導慢性晝夜節律錯位，允許詳細評估隨時間推移的皮質醇和炎症標誌物。
- 採用頻繁的血液採樣和恆定常規協議來準確測量晝夜節律和炎症反應，克服了之前研究中採樣頻率較低的限制。
- 作者認為急性睡眠剝奪和慢性晝夜節律錯位代表不同的生理挑戰，前者增加皮質醇，後者則減少皮質醇。
- 作者強調需要未來研究評估晝夜節律錯位對更廣泛的炎症標誌物和不同人群（包括患有既往疾病的人群）的影響。
- 該研究強調在睡眠和晝夜節律中斷期間，考慮促炎和抗炎蛋白質的重要性，以準確解釋炎症狀態。
- 研究結果表明，慢性晝夜節律錯位在健康個體中可能不會導致普遍的促炎狀態，因為促炎和抗炎蛋白質均增加。
