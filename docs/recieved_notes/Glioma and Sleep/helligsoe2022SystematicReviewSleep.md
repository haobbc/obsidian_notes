# TL;DR (Summary)
- 64% of patients (83/129) were diagnosed with sleep-related breathing disorders, including obstructive, central, and mixed sleep apnea.
- 63 patients were diagnosed with central disorders of hypersomnolence, such as hypersomnia or narcolepsy.
- The median age range at diagnosis was 5.6 to 10.1 years, at polysomnography (PSG) from 12.4 to 40.5 years, and time from diagnosis from 0.75 to 10.2 years.
- This study is the first systematic review to focus on PSG-diagnosed sleep disorders in childhood CNS tumor survivors.
- Examined the association between sleep disorders and tumor location, providing insights into potential links.
- Authors suggest the systematic registration of sleep disorder symptoms alongside tumor type and treatment information to identify at-risk patients early.
- Recommend future rigorous and larger scale controlled observational studies to explore modifiable confounders like fatigue and obesity.
- The study highlights a high occurrence of sleep disorders among CNS tumor survivors, with obstructive sleep apnea and narcolepsy being the most common.
- No clear association was found between tumor location and specific sleep disorders, despite the variety of tumor locations studied.

# 中文摘要 (TL;DR)
- 64% 的患者（83/129）被診斷出有與睡眠相關的呼吸障礙，包括阻塞性、中央性和混合性睡眠呼吸暫停。
- 63 名患者被診斷出有中樞性過度嗜睡症，如過度嗜睡或發作性睡病。
- 診斷時的中位年齡範圍為 5.6 至 10.1 歲，多導睡眠圖（PSG）時的中位年齡範圍為 12.4 至 40.5 歲，診斷後的時間範圍為 0.75 至 10.2 年。
- 這是首次針對兒童中樞神經系統腫瘤倖存者進行 PSG 診斷的睡眠障礙的系統性評論。
- 檢查了睡眠障礙與腫瘤位置之間的關聯，提供了潛在聯繫的見解。
- 作者建議系統性地記錄睡眠障礙症狀，與腫瘤類型和治療信息一起，以便早期識別高風險患者。
- 建議未來進行更嚴謹和更大規模的控制性觀察研究，以探討可修改的混雜因素，如疲勞和肥胖。
- 該研究強調了 CNS 腫瘤倖存者中睡眠障礙的高發生率，其中阻塞性睡眠呼吸暫停和發作性睡病是最常見的。
- 儘管研究了各種腫瘤位置，但未發現腫瘤位置與特定睡眠障礙之間的明確關聯。
