# TL;DR (Summary)
- The prevalence of insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, and poor sleep quality was 46.8%, 6.5%, and 81.8%, respectively.
- Circadian rhythm disruption was observed in approximately 60% of participants.
- Sleep quality was independently correlated with quality of life (B = 0.80, p = 0.02).
- Utilized actigraphy to objectively measure sleep parameters in patients with untreated pituitary tumor and meningioma, providing a novel approach to assess sleep disturbances in this population.
- Authors suggest that tumor location may not be a significant factor in sleep disturbances among patients with untreated pituitary tumor or meningioma.
- Recommend further research to explore the association between sleep disturbances and tumor location, as well as sleep trajectory before and after treatment.
- This study is the first to report a low prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with untreated pituitary tumor or meningioma.
- Highlights the importance of addressing sleep quality to improve quality of life in patients with brain tumors.

# 中文摘要 (TL;DR)
- 失眠、過度白天嗜睡和睡眠質量差的患病率分別為46.8%、6.5%和81.8%。
- 大約60%的參與者出現了晝夜節律紊亂。
- 睡眠質量與生活質量獨立相關（B = 0.80, p = 0.02）。
- 使用活動記錄儀客觀測量未經治療的垂體瘤和腦膜瘤患者的睡眠參數，為評估這一群體的睡眠障礙提供了一種新方法。
- 作者認為腫瘤位置可能不是未經治療的垂體瘤或腦膜瘤患者睡眠障礙的重要因素。
- 建議進一步研究探索睡眠障礙與腫瘤位置的關聯，以及治療前後的睡眠軌跡。
- 這是首次報導未經治療的垂體瘤或腦膜瘤患者過度白天嗜睡患病率低的研究。
- 強調改善腦瘤患者的生活質量時，需重視睡眠質量。
