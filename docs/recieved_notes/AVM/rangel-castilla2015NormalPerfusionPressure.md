# TL;DR (Summary)
- In studies supporting NPPB, autoregulation was found to be impaired in AVM feeding vessels in response to hyperventilation, with vasomotor paralysis observed in 2 out of 35 patients who later developed edema and hemorrhage post-resection.
- Postoperative cerebral blood flow (CBF) globally increased after AVM resection, with the worst vascular steal effect observed 2-4 cm distal to the AVM.
- Arterial stagnation post-AVM resection was associated with higher levels of oxygenation in brain tissue, contradicting the occlusive hyperemia theory.
- The review consolidates the complementary roles of NPPB and occlusive hyperemia theories, providing a unified perspective on the hemodynamic changes post-AVM resection.
- The authors believe that both NPPB and occlusive hyperemia theories are related and complementary, explaining hemodynamic changes after AVM resection.
- They advocate for maintaining normal blood pressure postoperatively in AVM resection patients, marking a shift from previous recommendations of hypotension.
- The authors suggest that further studies are necessary to fully elucidate the mechanisms of postoperative edema and hemorrhage in AVM patients.
- The review highlights the evolution of management strategies, moving away from intraoperative and postoperative hypotension to maintaining normal blood pressure.
- It emphasizes the need for individualized postoperative plans based on preoperative identification of patients at risk for NPPB or occlusive hyperemia.
# TL;DR (Summary)
- In studies using transcranial Doppler, autoregulation in AVM feeding vessels was impaired in response to hyperventilation.
- Vasomotor paralysis was observed in only 2 out of 35 patients preoperatively, but these patients developed edema and hemorrhage post-AVM resection.
- Postoperative cerebral blood flow (CBF) increased globally after AVM resection, with the worst vascular steal effect observed 2-4 cm distal to the AVM.
- The review consolidates the complementary roles of the normal perfusion pressure breakthrough (NPPB) and occlusive hyperemia (OH) theories in explaining postoperative complications after AVM resection.
- The authors believe that both NPPB and OH theories are related and complementary, explaining changes in hemodynamics post-AVM resection.
- They advocate maintaining normal blood pressure in the postoperative period for patients undergoing AVM resection.
- Further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms of these phenomena fully.
- The review highlights the evolution of management strategies, moving away from hypotension to maintaining normal blood pressure postoperatively.
- It emphasizes the need for more research to understand the pathophysiology and develop appropriate management protocols for postoperative complications.

# 中文摘要 (TL;DR)
- 在使用顱外多普勒的研究中，AVM供血血管對於高通氣的反應顯示自主調節受損。
- 術前僅有35名患者中的2名觀察到血管運動癱瘓，但這些患者在AVM切除後出現水腫和出血。
- AVM切除後，全球性腦血流量（CBF）增加，最嚴重的血管竊取效應在距AVM 2-4厘米處觀察到。
- 該評論整合了正常灌注壓力突破（NPPB）和閉塞性充血（OH）理論在解釋AVM切除後併發症中的互補作用。
- 作者認為NPPB和OH理論是相關且互補的，用於解釋AVM切除後的血流動力學變化。
- 他們建議在進行AVM切除的患者術後保持正常血壓。
- 需要進一步的研究來完全闡明這些現象的機制。
- 評論強調管理策略的演變，從術後低血壓轉向保持正常血壓。
- 它強調需要更多研究來理解病理生理學並制定適當的管理協議以應對術後併發症。
# TL;DR (Summary)
- AVM feeding artery mean arterial pressures (MAPs) show a 50% decrease compared to systemic MAP.
- Postoperative cerebral blood flow (CBF) increases globally after AVM resection.
- The review consolidates the complementary roles of NPPB and occlusive hyperemia theories, offering a new perspective on AVM resection complications.
- Authors believe that both NPPB and occlusive hyperemia theories explain changes in hemodynamics after AVM resection and are not mutually exclusive.
- They advocate for maintaining normal blood pressure postoperatively in AVM resection patients.
- The review highlights the need for further studies to elucidate the mechanisms of postoperative complications after AVM resection.
- It suggests that staged embolization and normotension may help prevent complications, though their efficacy remains to be systematically demonstrated.

# 中文摘要 (TL;DR)
- AVM供血動脈的平均動脈壓（MAP）與全身MAP相比降低50%。
- AVM切除後，術後腦血流量（CBF）整體增加。
- 該評論整合了NPPB和閉塞性充血理論的互補作用，對AVM切除後的併發症提供了一個新的視角。
- 作者認為NPPB和閉塞性充血理論都能解釋AVM切除後的血流動力學變化，且並非互斥。
- 他們建議在AVM切除後的患者中保持正常血壓。
- 該評論強調需要進一步研究以闡明AVM切除後的術後併發症機制。
- 它建議分階段栓塞和保持正常血壓可能有助於預防併發症，儘管其有效性仍需系統性證明。
